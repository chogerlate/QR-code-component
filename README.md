## What I learned 

I had learned a lot of things from this project. Firstly, I learned how to start my project properly for example how to clear html style with css, how to deal with scss compile, how to set up bootstrap to work with scss and how to organized my css/scss fill with 7-1 acchitecture. Secondly, I learned how to customize bootstrap components using scss custom.sass as u can see in the project. Thirdly, I learned how to deploy my website online using github, and lastly how to write this markdown.

In term the project part, I used bootstrap to create a card boilerplate and add more detail to it to create this one. I learned how to use flex-box and how to center things in css.
